# Authentication_app
Overview
This project implements a robust authentication system using both secret key authentication and RSA public-key cryptography. It is designed to provide secure communication between clients and servers, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

Features
1. Secret Key Authentication: Utilizes symmetric encryption to authenticate users with a shared secret key, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.
2. RSA Authentication: Implements asymmetric encryption using RSA keys to securely exchange messages and verify identities without requiring a shared secret.
3. Secure Data Transmission: Protects sensitive information during transmission using industry-standard cryptographic algorithms.
4. Modular Design: The code is organized into modules for easy maintenance and extensibility.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
1. Rust (version 1.50 or later)
2. Cargo (Rust package manager)
